# Morteza Sabri ‚Äì Portfolio

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ About Me
I am a geneticist by training and a bioinformatician by experience, with a strong passion for exploring complex biological systems through data. Since 2017, I have been working on various genomics and transcriptomics projects, combining biological insight with computational expertise. I am currently seeking opportunities to advance my research career through a PhD position.
